            <p>
            I am a passionate web developer with a diverse range of interests that complement my professional skills. Beyond my dedication to building dynamic and user-friendly websites, I love spending time outdoors, whether it's watching movies on vacations, going on bike rides, or simply relaxing with friends. My curiosity and drive to learn constantly push me to explore new technologies and innovative solutions. In my free time, I enjoy video editing and photography, capturing moments and creating visual stories. This blend of technical proficiency and varied interests shapes my approach to web development, making me a well-rounded and creative individual.
